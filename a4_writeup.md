# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part of this assingment was figuring out what code to write, in order for the program to do as intended. I understood what the  program was supposed to do, but I had trouble putting that into python.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I could add a computer player by assigning it to either X or O, then having a list of elif functions to determine where the computer should go in each turn.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I do not know what they exact algorithm is, but I know there is a seris of moves that a player can do in order to win almost every single time, I could tell the computer to play this seris of moves.
